Adds cardiology terminology, evidence quality, provenance, recency, clinical uncertainty, privacy, emergency escalation and safe-handoff checks. It may restrict behavior but never elevate authority, data, tools or memory.

Composition rule: minimum authority and the most restrictive clinical safety, data, tool and memory ceiling win. Runtime and availability are not created.
